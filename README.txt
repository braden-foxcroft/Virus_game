To run the game:
Open the page.html file in Google chrome (maybe it runs on other browsers too, who knows?)

Menu navigation:
- Press left and right to select a level.
- Press 'down' or 'enter' to confirm your choice
- Use left and right to select bonuses
- Press enter to toggle the bonus. Active bonuses have a dark blue outline
- Press down once you have selected the desired bonuses
- Press 'enter' to start the game.


Gameplay:
Use WASD or the arrow keys to control the infected process (red square)

Avoid all green things. The green squares are antivirus processes. They will kill you and erase infection.
The green bars are scans. Scans erase all infection.

In levels 1 and 2, there's a white box.
Try and get the white box. If you get it, you win.

In level 2 there is a purple square.
This square grants admin permissions. If you get this square, you gain the ability to hide.
Stand still to become undetectable!

In level 3, you are a key-logger. So long as a process stays active, you will collect valuable data.
Use the purple bar at the top to see your progress.

In level 4, you must encrypt all the user's data so that you can sell it back to them.
Encrypt a tile by infecting it.
Encrypted tiles are shown in faint purple.
Once a tile is encrypted, not even the antivirus can decrypt it!
Encrypt or infect every tile on the board to win!



Powerups:

Powerup 1: basic virus powers
In this game, the tiles represent files. The player and enemies are processes.
When an infected process interacts with a file, it infects it. Running an infected file spawns a new infected process.
Click on an infected tile to teleport to it, or respawn at it.
So long as you have at least 1 infected tile on the board, death won't cause you to lose. Simply respawn there to continue.
You lose if all infection is cleared, and if you are dead. If this powerup is disabled, you lose when you die.
You need this powerup for the last mission, but all other missions can be beaten without it.


Powerup 2: Logic bomb
Logic bombs are a special type of virus which is super hard to find.
The code in a logic bomb appears benign, but will sometimes have 'bugs' that are actually malicious behavior.
Since no program can perfectly identify bugs, it means that these malicious 'bugs' often go unnoticed
Enabling the powerup means that regular antivirus can't find you. Scans still can, though.

Powerup 3: Worm behavior
Worms are viruses which spread themselves. When they infect something, they will immediately try to infect anything nearby.
The worm powerup does this. Infection spreads automatically.

Powerup 4: Adobe Flash
Adobe Flash is a program that can be used to run online games.
For a long time, it was a staple of internet culture. Lots of kids (myself included) grew up on free flash games.
Unfortunately, Flash isn't being maintained, and is riddled with major security flaws.
Modern browsers no longer have flash enabled by default, and flash is no longer supported by most major websites.
